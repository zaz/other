In addition to the 5 repos listed at [github.com/zaz](https://github.com/zaz), these repositories may be of some use:

<dl>
	<dt><a href="https://github.com/zaz/bloom-filter">bloom-filter</a></dt>
		<dd>A fast 80-line bloom filter for JavaScript 6.</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://github.com/zaz/dijkstra">dijkstra</a></dt>
		<dd>A 60-line library with an efficient algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes in a graph.</dd>
</dl>

I have many more repos, but few are likely to be of use to you.
