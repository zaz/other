In addition to the 5 repos listed at [github.com/zaz](https://github.com/zaz), these repositories may be of some use:

[**bloom-filter** A fast 80-line bloom filter for JavaScript 6.](https://github.com/zaz/bloom-filter)  
[**dijkstra** A 60-line library with an efficient algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes in a graph.](https://github.com/zaz/dijkstra)

I have many more repos, but few are likely to be of use to you.
